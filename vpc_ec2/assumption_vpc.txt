- How do we create intnace from the store-backed-ami for each AWS user?
Do we need to copy the image into s3 bucket of user and than use that image?
Or
Do we need to register the image from store-backed0ami to amazon ebs-backed ami everytime?

- for creating spot instance we are using fix spot price which can stop to create instance if bid price is higher than our specified spot price
all instances are terminated, the bid is expired, or the bid falls below current market

Assumtion for creating VPC

 - using fixed  CidrBlock: "10.0.0.0/16" for the VPC
 - using fixed  CidrBlock: "10.0.1.0/24", for subnet
 - using fixed  DestinationCidrBlock: '0.0.0.0/0' when we create route

 - enabling dsn hostname for each VPC we have created
 - Adds one or more ingress rules to a security group.

inbound rule for port:8080 and port:80 for all CIDR range. CidrIp: '0.0.0.0/0'
